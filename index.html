    <h1>OUR WORLD IN DATA: HUMAN TRAFFICKING</h1>

  <div class="">
    <h1>Human Trafficking</h1>
    <p>Human trafficking is a serious social issue that continuous to affect millions of people across the world. 
      It is a multifaceted, complex hidden crime that involves exploitation of vulnerable populations for various notorious purposes. 
      It is a form of modern-day slavery in which individuals are exploited for labor or sexual exploitation usually through the use of force, or fraud.
      Victims of human trafficking often are vulnerable population seeking economic oppurtunities and are instead trapped in a system of abuse.  
      The aim of this project is to visualize human trafficking data at a macro scale showcasing the regions it is concentrated in, 
      and then at a country-specific level to understand the human trafficking trends at a granular level.</p>
  </div>
  <br />
  <h1>Human Trafficking Across the World</h1>
  
  <div class="home">
    <div id="map" style="margin-top: 60px; margin-left: -90px;"></div>
    
  </div>


  <div class="">
    <p>The choropleth world map visualizes where the count of human trafficking is concentrated. The dark green color shows the higher counts of Human Trafficking victim 
      followed by the sage color which shows a lower count of human trafficking in the nation which is followed by white regions where there is no recorded incident of human trafficking. 
      This is a limitation of the dataset where there was no record of human trafficking in particular countries. The lack of datapoints confirms the hidden nature of human trafficking crimes 
      and the need for more visibility and awareness.</p>
  </div>
  <br />


  <div class="">
    <h1>Human Trafficking Yearly Trend</h1>
    <div class="home1">
      <div id="trendgraph"></div>
    </div>
  </div>


  <div class="">
    <p>The bar chart visualizes the trend of human trafficking over the years which is increasing year over year. Human trafficking disproportionately impacts vulnerable and marginalized population in our society which often means low economic status. 
      Economic insecurity, conflict, and mass displacement are some of the many reasons why human trafficking continues to increase. The line graph is another component to the chart where it overlaps the bar chart and visualize the trend of human trafficking on a yearly basis. 
</p>
  </div>

  <div class="">
    <h1>Human Trafficking IN:</h1>
    <div class="home">
      <div id='vis-container'></div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="">
    <p>The timeseries bar chart zooms into a national level and demonstrates the trend of human trafficking in selected countries during the period of 2003 - 2017. It is important to note that the dataset is not complete and many nations have missing datapoints for specific years 
      highlighting the importance of complete data points for such important social issue. If the data was not a limitation, it would be interesting to zoom in further at a city level and visualize the trend. 
      </p>
  </div>
  <br />


  <div class="">
    <h1>Human Trafficking Overview Year 2017</h1>
    <div class="home">
        <div id="bargraph"></div>
    </div>
  </div>


  <div class="">
    <p>The bar chart looks at the specific year of 2017 and determines that Neathlerlands have the most significant count of Human Trafficking followed by Nigeria, Bangladesh and Mexico in second, third and forth place respectively. While the data doesn't show the full picture, according to 
       Dutch National Rapporteur on Trafficking in Human Beings and Sexual Violence against Children, it was estimated in the year 2017 that more than 6000 people in Neatherlands fall victim to human trafficking each year. It is considered Europe's top hotspot for Human Trafficking. However, 
      it is important to note that the dataset utilized in this project does not have all the data for many nations which can influence the number the countries are ranked. 
      </p>

    <h1>Conclusion:</h1>
    <p>In conclusion, a project that visualizes human trafficking can be a valuable tool for raising awareness and understanding of this complex issue. However, it is important to acknowledge that data on human trafficking can be limited as it is a hidden crime. Also, in countries where the issue is not well documented 
     or the data is well collected, it can be difficult to fully portray the reality of the issue. This project along with others may not capture full information and will provide partial representation of the issue.
